#  Testing Ruby with RSpec

> This is my test repo for testing Ruby with RSpec where I need to write RSpec tests for my Ruby projects. This is for me to practice the syntax of writing RSpec & to also practice thinking about test-cases/scenrarios that I need to pass for my Ruby projects.

## Built With

- Ruby (version <= 2.7.0p0)

## Prerequisites

- Ruby (version <= 2.7.0p0)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

From your command line, do the folowing steps below:
​
1. Clone the projects' repository into your machine.

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:chelmerrox/my_ruby_tic_tac_toe.git

```

2. Change directory/Go into the repository with the command below.

```bash
$ cd my_ruby_tic_tac_toe

```

3. Change directory into the bin folder.

```bash
$ cd bin

```

4. Run the `ls -l main.rb` command to check if the permission bits, `-rw-r--r--`, is the same as seen below.

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 username staff 20 Sep 24 01:05 main.rb

```

5. Run `chmod 755 -R main.rb` to change the permission bits and to make the `main.rb` file executable.

6. Run the `ls -l main.rb` command to check if the permission bits have changed to the one seen below.

```bash
-rwxr-xr-x username staff 20 Sep 24 01:05 main.rb

7. Change directory back into the root folder.

```bash
cd ../

```

8. Run `bin/main.rb` to execute the file and for you to begin playing the game on the terminal.
