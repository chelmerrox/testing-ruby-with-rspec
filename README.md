#  Testing Ruby with RSpec

> This is my test repo for testing Ruby with RSpec where I need to write RSpec tests for my Calculator class that has instance method definitions for the four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This is for me to practise the syntax of writing RSpec & to also practise thinking about different test-cases/scenarios that I need to pass for my Ruby projects.
